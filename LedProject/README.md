In this Project I try to control the on Board LED on the NodeMCU board with an Android app.

I use Things Speak API to communicate through internet. Since the free version of Things Speak limit the frequency of the messages to one message every 15 seconds I also blocked the switch in the android app fot this time so the user is now allowed to send more messages than this.
